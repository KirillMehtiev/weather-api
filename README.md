## Use Cases

After creating an account or logging in, use the **`userId`** to:

- **Create** weather subscriptions
- **Retrieve** all subscriptions for a specific **`userId`**
- **Delete** a specific subscription using both **`userId`** and **`subId`**

## Good to know

- Only English is supported for country and city names.
- **Each user can have up to 5 weather subscriptions.**
- The application is running with ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development, so be careful â€” you might see detailed stack traces. :)
